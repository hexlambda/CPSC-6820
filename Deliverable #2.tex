\section{Executive Summary}
It is not a good feeling to realize you did not feed your pet---whether it is because you were running late and were in a hurry or had too much on your mind and forgot about it. Times like these are when the Automatic Pet Feeder comes in handy. It comes with a nifty set of features to take care of your pet feeding needs including---the ability to set multiple food dispense times a day, on-device dispense schedule settings, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity to pair your mobile devices, a mobile app to receive notifications and view logs as well as to set the dispense schedule and the ability to set dispense quantities per each dispense time. Mobile device connectivity is fully optional and is intended for the user to check logs and remotely edit the dispense schedule.
